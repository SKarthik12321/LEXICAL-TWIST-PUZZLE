# Lexical Twist Puzzle – Java Console Application

## Overview
Lexical Twist Puzzle is a console-based Java program that works with two input words and applies a sequence of logical string operations. The application validates the inputs, checks reverse-word relationships, performs conditional transformations, and evaluates vowel and consonant patterns.  

The project is implemented incrementally using structured use cases and version-controlled using Git Flow.

## Functional Use Cases

UC1 — Display Title  
Shows the application title in the console.

UC2 — Input Handling  
Accepts two words from the user through standard input.

UC3 — Word Validation  
Ensures each input is a single word and not a sentence.

UC4 — Reverse Relationship Check  
Determines whether the second word is the reverse of the first.

UC5 — Conditional Transformation  
Applies a defined transformation only when the reverse condition is satisfied.

UC6 — Character Analysis  
Combines both words and calculates total vowels and consonants.

UC7 — Pattern Decision Rule  
Classifies the combined word pattern based on vowel–consonant dominance.

UC8 — Modular OOPS Design  
Refactors logic into dedicated validator and analyzer classes.

## Run Instructions

Compile:
javac src/main/java/com/lexicaltwist/*.java

Run:
java -cp src/main/java com.lexicaltwist.LexicalTwistPuzzle

## Version Control Method
Development was performed using Git Flow with separate feature branches for each use case and controlled merges into the develop branch.
